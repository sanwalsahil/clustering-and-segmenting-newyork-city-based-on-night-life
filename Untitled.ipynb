    "Nightlife of a city influences various businesses in a city and has a target audience that is growing very fast . Activities that a city has to offer can vary from lounges to night shows to beach bars to cafes all these sectors contribute to the economy and have various interconnected ecosystems within them . Here we study and organise clusters of neighborhoods based on these nighlife activities to study the patterns in data so we can suggest a hotel chain on where they can open their next hotel\n"

Such a model would be able to inform renters and home buyers who prefer to live where the nightlife is happening that their next home is properly located. Future nighlife activity start-ups can utilize the model to identify neighborhoods lacking nightlife and ensure they are investing in an area that is not saturated. "
